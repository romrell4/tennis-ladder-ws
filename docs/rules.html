        <h2>Ladder Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There will be no pre-established ladder rankings. Rankings will develop naturally as a result of matches played in the first few weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Invitations to play (challenges) can come from either the higher or lower-ranked player.
            </li>
            <li>
                Both players must bring a new can of decent balls to each match and the winner leaves with the unopened can.
            </li>
            <li>
                All matches will be best of three sets. The third set, if necessary, can be a 10-point tie break. Only if both players agree, a full third set can be played.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sets tied at 6-6 will be decided by a standard 7-point tie-break, which will count as one game as normal.
            </li>
            <li>
                The winning player should enter the score into the app immediately after the match has finished (hopefully within 30 minutes). We won't require the loser to formally confirm the result, but if the loser sees a discrepancy, he should resolve it with the winner and one of them should let me know immediately if a change is needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the distance system is "activated" (see below) no matches between players ranked more than 12 lengths from each other will count.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladder movement will be based on a two-tier point system calculated as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Base Points</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Winner - The winner of each match will be rewarded 39 points less the number of games won by the loser in the match.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Loser - The loser will receive one point for every game won in the match. If a third set tie-break is played, each point won in the 10-point tie break will count as 1/2 of a point, rounded up to a maximum of six points.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <i>
                            For example, if a match score is 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, the winner would receive 26 points (39 minus 13 games won by the loser) and the loser would receive 13 points.<br />
                            If a third set tie-break is played and the set scores are 6-4, 2-6, 10-7 then the winner would receive 25 points (39 points minus 10 games won minus 4 for the tie-break score). The loser would receive the other 14 points.
                        </i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Distance Points</b> - After the ladder has stabilized and rankings appear to reasonably reflect skill level, a distance penalty/premium system will be activated. This scoring system will be in addition to the base points and should reward wins against higher ranked players, as well as penalize wins against lower ranked opponents.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If a winner is higher ranked than a loser, the winner will forfeit 3 points for each rank they are above the loser.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a winner is lower ranked than a loser, the winner will earn 3 points for each rank they are below the loser.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Note that distance points only apply to winners, not losers. Losers will always keep whatever base points they earn.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Distance penalties cannot take a winner's score to less than zero.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <i>
                            For example, if a number 4 ranked player beats a number 8 ranked player 6-2, 6-4, the winner would receive 33 base points (39 - 6 games won by the loser), but would forfeit 12 of those points as a distance penalty (4 lengths * 3 points per length). The loser would earn 6 base points. <br />
                            On the other hand, if a number 10-ranked player beats a number 5 ranked-player 6-4; 5-7; 6-4, the winner would earn 24 base points (39 - 15 games won by loser), but would earn an additional 15 distance points (5 lengths * 3 points per length). The loser would earn 15 points for 15 games won.
                        </i>
